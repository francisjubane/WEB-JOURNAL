        <br><p>The most important features of IoT include artificial intelligence, connectivity, sensors, active 
          engagement, and small device use. A brief review of these features is given below. <br><br></p>
            <li><strong>AI</strong> − IoT essentially makes virtually anything “smart”, meaning it enhances every aspect of life 
              with the power of data collection, artificial intelligence algorithms, and networks. This can mean something 
              as simple as enhancing your refrigerator and cabinets to detect when milk and your favorite cereal run low, 
              and to then place an order with your preferred grocer.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Connectivity</strong> − New enabling technologies for networking and specifically IoT networking, mean 
                networks are no longer exclusively tied to major providers. Networks can exist on a much smaller and 
                cheaper scale while still being practical. IoT creates these small networks between its system devices.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sensors</strong> − IoT loses its distinction without sensors. They act as defining instruments that 
              transform IoT from a standard passive network of devices into an active system capable of real-world 
              integration.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Active Engagement</strong> − Much of today's interaction with connected technology happens through 
              passive engagement. IoT introduces a new paradigm for active content, product, or service engagement.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Small Devices</strong> − Devices, as predicted, have become smaller, cheaper, and more powerful over 
              time. IoT exploits purpose-built small devices to deliver its precision, scalability, and versatility.
            </li>

        <h3>What is IoT and how it works?</h3>
        <iframe width="852" height="480" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LlhmzVL5bm8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <h2><b>Application of IoT</b></h2><br>
      <p>The versatile nature of IoT makes it an attractive option for so many businesses, 
        organizations, and government branches, that it doesn’t make sense to ignore it. Here’s a sample of various 
        industries, and how IoT can be best applied.</p><br>
        <li><strong>Agriculture</strong> - For indoor planting, IoT makes monitoring and management of micro-climate conditions a reality, which in turn increases production. For outside planting, devices using IoT 
          technology can sense soil moisture and nutrients, in conjunction with weather data, better control smart 
          irrigation and fertilizer systems. If the sprinkler systems dispense water only when needed, for example, 
          this prevents wasting a precious resource.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer Use</strong>  - For private citizens, IoT devices in the form of wearables and smart 
          homes make life easier. Wearables cover accessories such as Fitbit, smartphones, Apple watches, health 
          monitors, to name a few. These devices improve entertainment, network connectivity, health, and fitness. 
          Smart homes take care of things like activating environmental controls so that your house is at peak comfort 
          when you come home. Dinner that requires either an oven or a crockpot can be started remotely, so the food 
          is ready when you arrive. Security is made more accessible as well, with the consumer having the ability to 
          control appliances and lights remotely, as well as activating a smart lock to allow the appropriate people to 
          enter the house even if they don’t have a key.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare</strong> - First and foremost, wearable IoT devices let hospitals monitor their 
          patients’ health at home, thereby reducing hospital stays while still providing up to the minute real-time
          information that could save lives. In hospitals, smart beds keep the staff informed as to the availability, 
          thereby cutting wait time for free space. Putting IoT sensors on critical equipment means fewer breakdowns 
          and increased reliability, which can mean the difference between life and death. Elderly care becomes 
          significantly more comfortable with IoT. In addition to the above-mentioned real-time home monitoring, 
          sensors can also determine if a patient has fallen or is suffering a heart attack.</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance</strong> - Even the insurance industry can benefit from the IoT revolution. Insurance 
          companies can offer their policyholders discounts for IoT wearables such as Fitbit. By employing fitness 
          tracking, the insurer can offer customized policies and encourage healthier habits, which in the long run 
          benefits everyone, insurer, and customer alike</li>
        <li><strong>Manufacturing</strong> - The world of manufacturing and industrial automation is another big
          winner in the IoT sweepstakes. RFID and GPS technology can help a manufacturer track a product from its 
          start on the factory floor to its placement in the destination store, the whole supply chain from start to finish. 
          These sensors can gather information on travel time, product condition, and environmental conditions that 
          the product was subjected to. Sensors attached to factory equipment can help identify bottlenecks in the 
          production line, thereby reducing lost time and waste. Other sensors mounted on those same machines can 
          also track the performance of the machine, predicting when the unit will require maintenance, 
          thereby preventing costly breakdowns.</li>
        <li><strong>Retail</strong> - IoT technology has a lot to offer the world of retail. Online and in-store shopping 
          sales figures can control warehouse automation and robotics, information gleaned from IoT sensors. Much 
          of this relies on RFIDs, which are already in heavy use worldwide. Mall locations are iffy things; business 
          tends to fluctuate, and the advent of online shopping has driven down the demand for brick and mortar 
          establishments. However, IoT can help analyze mall traffic so that stores located in malls can make the 
          necessary adjustments that enhance the customer’s shopping experience while reducing overhead. Speaking 
          of customer engagement, IoT helps retailers target customers based on past purchases. Equipped with the 
          information provided through IoT, a retailer could craft a personalized promotion for their loyal customers, 
          thereby eliminating the need for costly mass-marketing promotions that don’t stand as much of a chance 
          of success. Much of these promotions can be conducted through the customers’ smartphones, especially if 
          they have an app for the appropriate store.</li>
        <li><strong>Transportation</strong> - By this time, most people have heard about the progress being made 
          with self-driving cars. But that’s just one bit of the vast potential in the field of transportation. The GPS, 
          which if you think of it is another example of IoT, is being utilized to help transportation companies plot 
          faster and more efficient routes for trucks hauling freight, thereby speeding up delivery times. There’s 
          already significant progress made in navigation, once again alluding to a phone or car’s GPS. But city 
          planners can also use that data to help determine traffic patterns, parking space demand, and road 
          construction and maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Utilities</strong> - IoT sensors can be employed to monitor environmental conditions such as 
          humidity, temperature, and lighting. The information provided by IoT sensors can aid in the creation of 
          algorithms that regulate energy usage and make the appropriate adjustments, eliminating the human 
          equation (and let’s face it, who of us hasn’t forgotten to switch off lights in a room or turn down the 
          thermostat?). With IoT-driven environmental control, businesses and private residences can experience 
          significant energy savings, which in the long run, benefits everyone, including the environment! On a larger 
          scale, data gathered by the Internet of Things can be used to help run municipal power grids more 
          efficiently, analyzing factors such as usage. In addition, the sensors can help pinpoint outages faster, thereby 
          increasing the response time of repair crews and decreasing blackout times.</li>
